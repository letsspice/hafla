# Hafla

Hafla is a ticketing system designed to help event organizers streamline the process of managing and selling tickets for events. Whether you're hosting a tech conference, a music festival, or a community meetup, Hafla provides a simple and efficient way to handle event registration, ticket purchases, and attendee management.

The platform is built with the goal of providing a seamless experience for both attendees and organizers. Attendees can easily browse events, purchase tickets, and receive reminders before the event. Organizers can create events, manage ticket sales, and track attendees in real-time.

This application will help us practice:
1. Building a RESTful API using Ruby on Rails for handling events, ticket types, and user registrations.
2. Implementing secure user authentication and authorization using [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise).
3. Integrating a payment gateway (Stripe) for processing ticket purchases.
4. Sending event tickets via email (PDF/QR codes) and optional SMS notifications.
5. Setting up background jobs for sending event reminders (using [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/)).
6. Writing integrated unit tests with the [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) library to test API endpoints.
7. Documenting the API using the [Rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag) library to create API documentation.
8. Deploying the application on [Render](https://render.com/) for live access.

Enjoy using Hafla to manage your next event!
